Xylophone App
This Flutter application is a simple and interactive Xylophone, designed to be both educational and entertaining. It allows users to play different musical notes by tapping on buttons, each associated with a unique sound. The app is designed with a clean and vibrant user interface, making it suitable for all age groups, especially for young children who are interested in exploring music.

Features
Audio Playback: The app uses the audioplayers package to play audio files. Each button triggers the playback of a corresponding musical note in .wav format.
Interactive UI: The app's interface consists of a series of colorful buttons. Each button is labeled with a Chinese character and a corresponding pinyin sound, providing a cultural twist to the traditional Xylophone.
Custom Styling: The buttons are styled with vibrant colors and have a unique, leaf-like shape created using a StadiumBorder. The app's background is decorated with a custom image, giving it a visually appealing design.
AppBar Design: The app features a custom AppBar with a dark purple theme and white text, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the app.
Code Structure
Main Class (MyApp): This class sets up the main structure of the app, including the MaterialApp and the Scaffold for the home screen.
Stateful Widget (Xylo): The Xylophone functionality is handled in this widget. It manages the state of the app, particularly the audio playback.
Audio Management: The app utilizes the AudioPlayer instance to handle the playback of sound files. The playSound method is called when a user taps on a button, playing the corresponding note.
Button Creation: The createNewButton method dynamically generates the buttons on the screen, each associated with a different sound and color.
